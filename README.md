Contact Me Webpage
A simple and elegant contact form webpage that allows users to reach out by providing their name, email, and phone number. The footer includes links to my LinkedIn and Twitter profiles, making it easy for users to connect with me on social media.

Note: This project is currently a frontend-only implementation. Adding a backend to handle data submission and fetching is my next week's target.
